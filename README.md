# House_price_predection

This project is done to make housing predection implementing various Machine libraries. 
I have tried to go through various phases of Data science life cycle to make the predections which are as follows:
1.  Data Import and Exploratory Data Analysis
    In this stage I have imported data from local directory (main source: Kaggle) and then performed EDA to have a better understanding
    of the data. 
2. Data Cleaning 
    In this stage I have analyzed various features of data such as handling null values, handling skewness of the data, removing outliers     etc. 
    
3. Data Preparation
    In this stage, I have handled various categorical features using Label Encoder and have also performed feature engineering inorder to     improve the performance of our Machine learning model.
4. Model fitting
    I have mainly focused on this section, focusing on implementation of various machine learning algorithms: Ridge Regression, Lasso         Regression, Random Forest,K nearest Neighbors, Support vectorm machines, ElasticNet and also various Bossting techiniques such as         Gradient Boost, Light GBM, XGBoost. Apart from this, I have also tried using Pipelines and Staking techniques along with Hypertuning       optimization using Gridsearch CV 
5. Making Predictions and Evalutiong performance
    In this stage all the models are used to make predectiona and their performance has been compared using visualization. The metrics         used  for evaluation is mean squared error
